            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <p>Complex configurations don't mix well with rapidly spun-up components, and when your company uses
                multiple cloud providers to host your critical assets, the odds of a major security event get
                that much
                higher.
            </p>
            <p>So, how do you close visibility gaps and integrate conflicting datasets from different providers,
                and how
                do you adjust your current incident response strategies to respond to cloud-specific threats?
            </p>
            <p>
                Read the report from SANS Instructor Dave Shackleford to learn how your peers across tech,
                finance,
                cybersecurity, and other industries address the following questions and more:
            </p>
            <p>What's the most dangerous cloud security vulnerability that you might think is only hype?</p>
            <p>What are the biggest challenges in adapting IR and forensics analysis to the cloud?</p>
            <p>What are the most effective security controls for the cloud, and how can you avoid common
                implementation roadblocks?
            </p>
