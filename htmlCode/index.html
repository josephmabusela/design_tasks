                    <p>Complex configurations don't mix well with rapidly spun-up components, and when your company uses
                        multiple cloud providers to host your critical assets, the odds of a major security event get that much
                        higher.
                    </p>
                    <p>So, how do you close visibility gaps and integrate conflicting datasets from different providers, and how
                        do you adjust your current incident response strategies to respond to cloud-specific threats?
                    </p>

                    </p>
                            <p>What's the most dangerous cloud security vulnerability that you might think is only hype?</p>
                            <p>What are the biggest challenges in adapting IR and forensics analysis to the cloud?</p>
                            <p>What are the most effective security controls for the cloud, and how can you avoid common
                                implementation roadblocks?
