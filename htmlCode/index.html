          Complex configurations don't mix well with rapidly spun-up components,
          and when your company uses multiple cloud providers to host your
          critical assets, the odds of a major security event get that much
          higher.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, how do you close visibility gaps and integrate conflicting datasets
          from different providers, and how do you adjust your current incident
          response strategies to respond to cloud-specific threats?

          </li>
          <li>
            What are the biggest challenges in adapting IR and forensics analysis
            to the cloud?
          </li>
          <li>
            What are the most effective security controls for the cloud, and how
            can you avoid common implementation roadblocks?
